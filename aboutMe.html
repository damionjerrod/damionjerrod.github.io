                        <p>I consider myself to be a fairly creative person. I think we all are actually, but most of us rarely dig deep enough into the recesses of who we are in order to tap into the wells of this abundant personal resource. Creativity is needed too. I didn't understand myself for a long time. I dealt with frustrations about my place in the world and what meant satisfaction to me. I now know that because I'm considered to be what's called a "creative", it's necessary for me to find expression for whatever happens to be buried deep within the caverns of my soul. Out of that place comes things like joy, beauty, pain, remorse, anguish, bliss, and a plethora of emotions we all can understand on a subconscious level.</p>
                        <p>To create is to live. It's in the chaotic, yet organic place of personal creation an individual can find their greatest joy. At least that's what I've found to be true for me. I am not "me" unless I am allowing my internal-self to find expression through unhindered creation. This is where the self is discovered, created, and realized all at the same time. So, in short, I'm just a creative guy.</p>

                        <p>Now, I know we just went through this semmingly whimsical word journey of describing me as a creative junky, but allow me to make a minor amendment. I'm just Jerrod. A guy... A regular guy at that. Nothing special about me. No bells and whistles. Nothing. I am a "me", an individual. We can boast all day long about the various intricacies that define and constitute us. But at the end of the day, we're just people. Human beings are human beings. Don't get me wrong, we're fine creatures. But truth be told, we're all quite the same. That's the beautiful thing about humanity: No matter how different I may seem from you, I'm just like you and you're just like me. We're human. So, if you'd like to know who I am... Know that I'm Just Jerrod.</p>
